Small project on text analysis via CNN's within a uni seminar. Using an alphabet-based character-level dummy-encoding allows for the application of 1D Cnns for classification of yelp reviews. Based on work from [Zhang, Zhao and LeCunn (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626). Also included Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (**LIME**) by [Marco Ribeiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/blog/lime/) to make sense out of complex decision makers such as CNNs.
